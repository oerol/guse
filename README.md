`GUSE` is a powerful day planner that utilizes the concept of [timeboxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing). to help you stay organized and productive. With `GUSE`, you can easily schedule your tasks and appointments, set time limits for each activity, and track your progress throughout the day.

## Usage

- Create categories and assign activities to them
- Drag and drop activities into the day
- Change duration of activites by resizing
- Assign todos to daily activities

`GUSE` is currently in active development and there may be some features that are not fully operational or may contain bugs. I appreciate your understanding and patience as I work on improving the user experience.

## Features in development

- Interactive tutorial on how to use the application
- Support for mobile devices
- Detection of patterns and assistance with suggestions
- Reward system
